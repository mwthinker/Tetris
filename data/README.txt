The Game MWetris is a Tetris clone with network capabilities. You 
can play up to 4 human players on one computer and up to 4 computer opponents.
The first two human players uses the keyboard and the rest uses any connected gamepad.

The game uses OpenGL and could in theory be ran under multiple platforms 
(e.g. Windows, Linux and MAC).

Player 1: Is controlled by the arrows key on keyboard.
Player 2: Is controlled by the (a,s,d,w) keys on keyboard.
Player 3-4: Is controlled by any gamepad connected to the computer.

The network uses TCP so the chosen port may has to be 
port forwarding if an router is used.
